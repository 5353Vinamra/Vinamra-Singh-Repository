### Section 4 - Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree

#### Brief Overview

Introduction to Timing Libraries and Steps to Include New Cells in Synthesis
Timing libraries, also known as Liberty (.lib) files, contain information about standard cells, including delay, power, and functionality. These libraries are crucial for the synthesis and timing analysis of a digital design.
When adding a new cell to synthesis, several steps need to be followed:

Characterizing the cell for different process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) conditions.
Extracting timing information using SPICE simulations.
Generating a .lib file with accurate delay and power values.
Integrating the .lib file into the synthesis tool to ensure proper usage in the design.
Running synthesis and place-and-route to verify timing closure.
Introduction to Delay Tables
Delay tables define how the delay of a logic gate varies based on input transition time and output load capacitance. These tables allow synthesis and timing tools to estimate the propagation delay of signals through different paths in the circuit.

Different types of delay models include:

Linear Delay Model (LDM): Simplified model assuming a linear relationship between delay and load.
Non-Linear Delay Model (NLDM): More accurate, using lookup tables based on input transition time and output load.
Composite Current Source (CCS): Uses current waveforms to model gate behavior more precisely.
Effective Current Source Model (ECSM): Similar to CCS but includes power modeling.
Delay Table Usage Part 1
Delay tables are used during timing analysis to predict how long a signal takes to propagate through a gate under different conditions. These tables help in:

Synthesis: Choosing the best standard cell for optimization.
Static Timing Analysis (STA): Checking if the circuit meets setup and hold timing requirements.
Place and Route (P&R): Ensuring that routing does not introduce excessive delay.
Each standard cell in the library has a delay table that is indexed by input transition time and output capacitance.

Delay Table Usage Part 2
Advanced usage of delay tables involves:

Interpolating values between given points in the table to estimate delay more accurately.
Accounting for voltage and temperature variations that affect delay.
Handling signal integrity issues such as noise, crosstalk, and glitches.
Using advanced delay models like CCS and ECSM for better accuracy in modern designs.
Setup Timing Analysis and Introduction to Flip-Flop Setup Time
Setup time is the minimum time before the clock edge when data must be stable for a flip-flop to correctly capture it. Violating the setup time leads to setup violations, which result in incorrect data being latched.

Steps in setup timing analysis:

Extract setup timing constraints from the timing library.
Calculate clock arrival time and data arrival time.
Check if the data arrives before the required setup time.
Apply timing fixes like buffer insertion, gate sizing, or register retiming if violations occur.
Introduction to Clock Jitter and Uncertainty
Clock jitter is the variation in the arrival time of the clock edges due to noise, power supply variations, and process variations. It affects the timing margin of the design and can lead to setup or hold violations.

Types of clock jitter:

Cycle-to-cycle jitter: Variation between consecutive clock cycles.
Long-term jitter: Accumulated variation over multiple cycles.
Phase jitter: Deviation of the clock phase from the ideal timing.
Clock uncertainty is the additional timing margin added to account for jitter and other timing variations. It helps ensure robustness in real-world scenarios.

Clock Tree Routing and Buffering Using H-Tree Algorithm
Clock tree routing is the process of distributing the clock signal throughout the chip while minimizing clock skew. The H-Tree algorithm is one of the most commonly used techniques for this.

Steps in H-Tree clock distribution:

Divide the design into quadrants and distribute the clock symmetrically.
Place buffers at branching points to strengthen the clock signal.
Ensure that all paths have equal delays to minimize skew.
Perform timing optimization to reduce power consumption and improve clock synchronization.
The advantage of the H-Tree method is its symmetry, which ensures uniform delays across the chip, making it ideal for high-speed designs.

Crosstalk and Clock Net Shielding
Crosstalk occurs when signals in adjacent wires interfere due to capacitive and inductive coupling. This can lead to unwanted noise, timing violations, and glitches.

Methods to reduce crosstalk:

Increase spacing between critical nets.
Use shielding layers (ground or power lines) around clock nets to reduce interference.
Route high-speed signals on separate metal layers.
Optimize wire width and spacing in the place-and-route stage.
Clock net shielding is particularly important because clock signals have strict timing requirements and cannot tolerate variations caused by crosstalk.

Setup Timing Analysis Using Real Clocks
Setup timing analysis with real clocks accounts for actual clock propagation delays, jitter, and routing effects. This is done after clock tree synthesis (CTS) to ensure that the real clock arrival times are considered in the timing calculations.

Key considerations:

Clock skew: Difference in clock arrival times at different flip-flops.
Clock uncertainty: Additional margin for variations.
Clock buffers and delays: Impact on timing paths.
By using real clock delays, setup analysis becomes more accurate, helping to identify timing violations that might not appear in an idealized pre-layout analysis.

Hold Timing Analysis Using Real Clocks
Hold timing analysis ensures that data remains stable for a minimum period after the clock edge to avoid incorrect latching. If the data changes too soon, a hold time violation occurs.

Steps in hold timing analysis:

Determine actual clock arrival times after clock tree synthesis.
Check if the data remains stable for the required hold time after the clock edge.
Analyze hold margin considering real clock delays and routing effects.
Fix hold violations by adding buffers or delaying the clock signal at certain points.
Hold timing violations are particularly challenging because they cannot be fixed by simply increasing the clock period. Instead, adjustments must be made at the circuit level.
